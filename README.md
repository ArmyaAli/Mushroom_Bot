## Mushroom_Bot
Hi! This is a discord bot that's my very own. I wrote it for myself to use and maybe show to my friends and make it do stuff. I originally wrote a bunch of features with vanilla js and node but I wanted to use typescript so I will be migrating my old code to this piece by piece. Once that's complete i'll start adding more features!

## Motivation
This project exists because I wanted to learn more about the typescript/javascript ecosystem. What better way to learn than by doing a project?
